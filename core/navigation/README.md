# Navigation Extensions

This library is built as an abstraction of the [FragmentTransaction](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/fragment/app/FragmentTransaction) API.
It doesn't add any extra functions, just some extension functions for make the api mor easier to use.

## Features
 - Extension functions for ADD & REPLACE fragments.
 - Load classes by qualified name.
